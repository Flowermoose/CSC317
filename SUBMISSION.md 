Reflection:

I learned a lot about working in github during the group assignment. I found was difficult to balance
fully implementing a feature and avoiding merge conflicts. For example while I was working with pin creation
I had to alter the pin route, the controller and I had to test it on the home page. If anyone else worked on
those at the same time we may have gotten a merge conflict. I got around this by researching how to implement my feature
before starting, and getting my work done earlier in the morning. Another way we could have dealt with this is by
assigning each person a different page, but since we are so new to web development, and learning the back end required
understanding how everything connected, I feel like our way worked better, for me at least.

It took me a while to understand the back end. The way the routes were called and the convoluted naming conventions
made it difficult for me to understand what was happening, but I got used to it eventually. I was able to repurpose
user to make pins, but I had to learn about using the database as well
