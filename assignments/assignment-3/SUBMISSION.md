# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis

## Analysis
The ai did a good job getting the basic formatting down but the color schemes were hit or miss.
The ai frequently chose color schemes without enough contrast to be legible. Just in general it made illogical choices.
In one case it had the entire page fade in over half a second, but it also had several other animations 
running on different elements at the same time.
I could have done better with the prompting, that would have made the ai more convenient too. I didn't 
include the html in the prompt so there was a lot of stuff from the css that did not translate to the html.
I found it difficult to know where to start when I was working from scratch. when I started styles.css I was 
just making modifications to my original html page instead of making big changes. I think I would do a better 
job if I was making one from scratch now but I found that having a good starting point helped me make a better page.
The hybrid approach was fun because I got to combine my favorite parts of the files and add on new features that we
learned in class


## Lessons Learned
The prompt I used was not specific enough, I just asked for a css file with a color scheme.
I did not see the suggested prompt until I had already used parts of the files for hybrid.css.
I do think I learned a lot from what I got, and because it did not correspond with my html file
very well I had to spend more time figuring out what every part of the ai files meant. I feel like
I learned a lot from that process

## Preferred Version
I prefer the final hybrid version. I combined my favorite parts of each and improved 
on my original design. I enjoyed having more control over the project and making the 
page more responsive.
